# LongNumbersArithmetic
A web project, that has 3 pages, the main one which has references to the two other pages,
one of them is Long Numbers Addition and the other is Long Number Multiplication.
The project was made on eclipse environment with java language. 
In order to make it start, you need to run any of the jsp files.
The multiplication function was challenging with the restriction to only using int[] while calculating the results which gave me a problem with array sizing.
If i had more time i would maybe come up with a nicer solution.
